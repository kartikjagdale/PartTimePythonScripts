#Filename:Physical-Logical Line
i=5
print(i)
#is Efeectively Same as
i=5;
print(i);
#and the Same can be Written as
i=5;print(i);
#or even
i=5;print(i)
#However, I strongly recommend that you stick to writing a single logical line in a
#single physical line only.

#Another Example of Explict Line Joining
s='This is a String .\
This Continues the String'
print(s)

#Output is
#This is a String. This Continues the String.
#print\
#(i)
#is same as
#print(i)
